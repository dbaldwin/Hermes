# Saving your code

Saving your code with Hermes is easy. 

You can use File-&gt;Save and File-&gt;Load. 

This will save all the code in your program and any variables you have created.

Hermes uses the .space extension, which is simply a container holding your entire workspace. In the future support will be added to easily open .space files with Hermes.

Hermes using Scratch Blocks, a block based programming language designed to make it easy to start working with programming. To program with Scratch Blocks simply drag the blocks you wish to use out from the left toolbox into the open canvas area. All chunks of code start with the Green Flag.

This is some example code showing off how to program the drone to fly in a square. The code will continue to execute until its end, but will not automatically tell the drone to land. It is recommended to end every program with the land block.
